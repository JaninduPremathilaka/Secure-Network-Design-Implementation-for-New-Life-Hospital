A comprehensive network design and implementation project for New Life Hospital, completed as part of my Higher National Diploma in Network Engineering at NIBM Colombo.

---
- **Designed and implemented a multi-floor hospital network with full Wi-Fi coverage and VLAN-based segmentation for departments like HR, IT, and OPD.**
- **Configured Cisco Layer 2/3 switches with HSRP, VTP, EtherChannel, SSH, and PVST for high availability and secure management.**
- **Deployed pfSense firewalls for traffic control, proxy filtering, and internet access policies (e.g., social media blocking).**
- **Set up Windows Server for DHCP, DNS, and Active Directory roles; implemented secure IP planning and address assignment.**
- **Installed and configured VMware ESXi and vCenter for virtualized server management, integrating NAS-based shared storage.**
- **Deployed Nagios XI for real-time network monitoring and service status tracking.**
- **Followed best practices in documentation, security, and scalability to meet enterprise healthcare IT needs.**
